"""
  Program to read in temperatures from provided CSV file.
  Will send temperatures to respective consumers based on
    what we are reading the temperatures of (smoker, foods).

  Author: Solomon Stevens
  Date: May 31, 2024

  Copied and modified from streaming-04-multiple-consumers/v3_emitter_of_tasks.py

  Basic Steps:
  1. If 'SHOW_WEB' is set to True, ask user if they want to open RabbitMQ Admin website
     -> If yes, open website
  2. Open the CSV file
  3. Create a CSV reader object
  4. Create a connection and channel to stream the data in the CSV file
  5. Declare three queues
  6. Create three tuples from the CSV file
     -> (Time, Temperature of the smoker)
     -> (Time, Temperature of the first food)
     -> (Time, Temperature of the second food)
  7. Send each tuple to their respective queue
